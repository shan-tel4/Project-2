## Project Description



### Objectives:

## Colour Palette:

The Shay Mixer 5000's design emulates the aesthetic of professional DJ equipment, featuring a dark-themed interface with a deep blue background (#4a4d63) that minimises eye strain and enhances focus. The mixer panels are set against a slightly darker shade (#2a2d43), creating a subtle contrast that defines different sections without overwhelming the user. Accents in a soft pink hue (#f5b0c4) highlight key elements such as the logo and deck labels, drawing attention to important features. This color scheme not only reflects the vibrant atmosphere of DJ environments but also ensures clarity and usability, aligning with the visual language commonly found in DJ interfaces.

## Wireframes

The wireframe was designed on ![Visily](https://www.visily.ai/) depicts a modern and minimalist DJ controller interface designed for an interactive web project, as seen on the linked project webpage. It features two decks labeled "Deck A" and "Deck B," each equipped with rotary controls and sliders for precise audio manipulation. At the center, a crossfader allows seamless transitions between decks, while additional buttons and knobs provide access to further functionalities, such as effects or equalizer controls. The design balances simplicity and usability, creating a clean aesthetic that is visually engaging while emphasizing intuitive operation for users.

## Key Features

- **Dual Decks**: Two separate decks labeled "Deck A" and "Deck B" enable users to upload and manage individual audio tracks, facilitating seamless transitions and mixing.


- **Interactive Jog Wheels**: Each deck features a responsive jog wheel with a spinning marker, mimicking the tactile experience of physical DJ equipment. The jog wheels are designed with vinyl-like grooves and a central label to enhance realism.


- **Playback Controls**: Users have access to essential playback functions, including play, pause, loop, and sync, allowing for dynamic control over each track.



- **Speed and Pitch Adjustment**: Each deck includes a speed control slider with a range of playback rates, accompanied by a "Preserve Pitch" option to maintain audio fidelity during tempo changes.


- **Crossfader**: A central crossfader enables smooth blending between Deck A and Deck B, providing intuitive control over the audio output.


## Technical Implementation:

- **Frontend**: Developed using HTML, CSS and JS, the interface employs a grid layout to organise components, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly design.


- **Audio Handling**: The application utilises the Web Audio API, with integration of the WaveSurfer.js library for audio visualisation and manipulation, offering precise control over audio playback and effects.
